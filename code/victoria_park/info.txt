*** laser data:
file : aa3_lsr2.mat



LASER is a uint16 matrix, 361 columns, N rows. 
      column k corresponds to the range in direction of angle Ak =  (k-1)*/2    (in de degrees)
      the ranges are in CM.
      ranges  higher than 8000 cm are considered  'no reflexion' (infinite distance).

TLsr is the time vector, dimm = Nx1. it is uint32 type. 


then LASER(k,:) is a laser frame, with timestamp  TLsr(k).


==================================
*** dead-reckoning data:

in file aa3_dr.m.

variables:

speed    	: in m/secs.
steering        : in radians.
time            : in millisecs.


speed(k), steering(k) are related to timestamp time(k).


do 

load aa3_dr.mat
figure(1) ; clf ; plot(time,speed) ; xlabel('time  (ms)') ; ylabel('speed, (m/sec)') ;
figure(2) ; clf ; plot(time,steering) ; xlabel('time  (ms)') ; ylabel('steering, (rads)') ;

==================================
*** gps  data.

Lo_m : longitude (in meters)
La_m : latitude (in meters)
timeGps : time in msecs.


obs: the gps unit was failing, it is possible to see jumps and regions without gps data.

run :

clear all; 
load aa3_gpsx ; plot(Lo_m,La_m,'.') ;

==================================


*** run  ViewLsr.m to see the laser data (dynamically) 

===================================

use DetecTrees.m  to get the landmarks from the laser frame data.
see ViewLsr code to see how to use it.

===================================


CAR parameters: (see car.bmp drawing)

a  : 0.95 m
b  : 0.5  m
H  : 0.76 m 
L  : 2.83 m
